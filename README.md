Enter your name, and wait for an opponent.
Click on the images to play once your name is entered.

Known bugs:

Chat will display the last entry when the page freshly loads.

Features that need to be added:
Way for players to quit. Right now, if new players want to play, a brand new window must be opened.
In addition, the database doesn't clean itself. (Thus the reset button).
